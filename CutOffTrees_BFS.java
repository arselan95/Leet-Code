/*
You are asked to cut off trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as a non-negative 2D map, in this map:

0 represents the obstacle can't be reached.
1 represents the ground can be walked through.
The place with number bigger than 1 represents a tree can be walked through, and this positive number represents the tree's height.
 

You are asked to cut off all the trees in this forest in the order of tree's height - always cut off the tree with lowest height first. And after cutting, the original place has the tree will become a grass (value 1).

You will start from the point (0, 0) and you should output the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you can't cut off all the trees, output -1 in that situation.

You are guaranteed that no two trees have the same height and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.

Example 1:

Input: 
[
 [1,2,3],
 [0,0,4],
 [7,6,5]
]
Output: 6
 

Example 2:

Input: 
[
 [1,2,3],
 [0,0,0],
 [7,6,5]
]
Output: -1
 

Example 3:

Input: 
[
 [2,3,4],
 [0,0,5],
 [8,7,6]
]
Output: 6
Explanation: You started from the point (0,0) and you can cut off the tree in (0,0) directly without walking.

/*
 * Create a list of int[] which contains x_coordinate, y_coordinate, and height of tree

Add all the trees which have height >1 to the list.

Sort the given list based on their height, by using the Comparator class(or simply using Lambda expression from Java8)
Then traverse through each tree by using a BFS

In the BFS we are checking the distance needed to go to the tree from the current source 
coordinates(Since we have sorted the trees based on their height, our source coordinates will be 
different from the tree coordinates)

For eg: Our input is like this [[1,0,0],[1,0,0],[1,1,5]], then

i) We have only 1 entry to be traversed, which is {x,y,height} = {2,2,5}

ii) Once we have sorted the input trees, we are going to apply BFS

iii) Our source coordinates are (0,0) and our tree coordinates are (2,2) 
nd then using BFS we are going to find out the shortest distance needed to to go from source to destination.
