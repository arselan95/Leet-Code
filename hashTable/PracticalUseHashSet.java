 * As we know, it is easy and effective to insert a new value and check if a value is in a hash set or not.

Therefore, typically, a hash set is used to check if a value has ever appeared or not.

//EXAMPLE
/*
 * Let's look at an example:

Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. 

This is a typical problem which can be solved by a hash set.

You can simply iterate each value and insert the value into the set. 
FIf a value has already been in the hash set, there is a duplicate.
